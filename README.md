# ValorantRNG-Website

Website isn't finished just a project I'm working on, on the side. 

I need to update a lot of things such adding the rest of the agents, maps and setting images for all of them. making them all fit nicely on the page.

change option to re roll individual along with all.

(maybe rebuild agent select on valorant using layers for images??) 

sometime later.


CHALLENGES:

Silent but deadly: You must set your game’s master volume to 0, Wild west: You ignore all other RNG picks and only use Sheriffs. Armor is allowed, but no other guns. Use a western accent while making callouts, Shout casters: While alive you must narrate every action that you make. Do this as a shout caster would while spectating a professional match, Doppelgänger: If there is an enemy on the other team with the same agent as you, you must ignore all other enemies until you have killed your doppelgänger, SABOTAGE: The opposing team must pick your guns for you, PEW PEW!: you must make sound effects for everything you do, STEALTH: Ignore other RNG picks and only buy surpressed weapons and you can only whisper and make quiet noises with your hands, SECRET SERVICE: You must elect a president, who you try anything to protect such as throwing yourself in front of them and eliminating the threat, SPEEDRUN: if a defender you cannot leave spawn until spike is planted (if you're an attacker reroll), LITTLE BIT OF MOTIVATION: You must elect one member of your team to give a motivational speech at the start of the round (you may elect yourself), and you may not leave spawn until it's done, HI!!!!!: Whenever you see an enemy, you must pause to say hi in the chat
