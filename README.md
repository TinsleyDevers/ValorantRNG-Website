# ValorantRNG-Website

Website isn't finished just a project I'm working on, on the side. 

I need to update a lot of things such adding the rest of the agents, maps and setting images for all of them. making them all fit nicely on the page.

(maybe rebuild agent select on valorant using layers for images??) 

sometime later.
